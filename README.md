# Introduction:
Our game, Frenzy Penguins, involves sending a penguin off a ramp through the skies. Throughout your journey, you will be able to guide the penguin through the air, accumulating points for the distance that you travel and purchasing equipemnt to stay airborne for as long as you can!

Controls: Use keys to control the penguin's movement.<br>
  Right key: Begin the penguin's descent down the ramp.<br>
  A and D keys: Change teh angle at which the penguin falls.<br>
  Space key: Activate the jetpack, one of the purchaseable items in the store.<br>

Features: <br>
  Speedometer and Altimeter: Monitor the penguin's speed and altityde in real-time.<br>
  Clouds and Snow: Encounter randomly spawned snow and clouds while in the menu or in game.<br>

Store:
As you travel further with the penguin, you gain more points. You can use those points to purchase and/or upgrade the following.<br>
  Jetpack: The jetpack applies a force in teh direction in which the penguin faces. The higher the jetpack level, the stronger the force.<br>
  Sled: The sled reduces the friction of the penguin along various surfaces. A higher level means less friction.<br>
  Glider: The glider ap[lies a force of lift which keeps the penguin in the air longer.<br>
  Ramp level: Upgrading the ramp level allows you to initially get launched down with more force.<br>


# Project Environment: 
The project will be developped using the following: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDE: IntelliJ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Archetype:  Maven <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Management Application: Jira <br>
